<h2>Cube World: Contradictory Mechanics</h2>
<h3>Posted by Jeven</h3>
<em>2017 08 15</em>
<p>I was asked jokingly to share my thoughts about the infamous <a href="https://picroma.com/cubeworld">Cube World</a>. I took the request as both an insult and a challenge but alas I failed the challenge and continue to be insulted by the request.
So here we go.</p>

<p>For those uninitiated: Cube World is a procedural generated open world RPG.</p>

<p>Cube World does not have a current version available for download so I had to dig around for a copy from what I imagine is a half decade ago. It was noted as an alpha, but none the less should have the initial mechanics intended by the designer. An alpha, in my humble opinion, should contain base game experience so that the testers, you and I, the fools for purchasing early access, are able to generate usable feed back on the game for the designer to work from.</p>

<p>With such a philosophy in mind, some of the core mechanics, exploration and combat, were either missing or felt controversial to the core game play. Initially these mechanics feel independent to one another, but instead of inspecting them solely as separate ideas, they can also be compared together by how they either compliment or disfavour each other.</p>

<p>Spawning into the game presents a landscape ripe with mystery. Bright colours, obscure structures, and dramatic landscapes are fantastic tools for obtaining the player's attention. Cube World immediately communicates and emphasizes that it is about exploring the world. Character movement feels quick and responsive making every movement feel worth the player's time, it is an enjoyable world to be in. <em>Flashback to early 3D platformers where you cross dead space while holding down an auxiliary move button to keep yourself interested. I'm looking at you Legend of Zelda roll button.</em> In addition to being an interesting world, the world is random and endless, providing an exciting fresh non linear experience every step. Exploring feels great in Cube World.</p>

<p>Combat is boring. And by extension; enemies are boring. <em>These observations are from early in the game since I did not progress very far.</em> Melee creatures run at you in a direct path at the same speed that you move at. Ranged enemies follow the same pattern stopping short of the player and shooting directly at them. The ability to kite or mislead the enemy is impossible or nullified due to the speed in which they move and the perfect path that they take. Any interesting or complex actions are left to the weapon mechanics which are also lacking. Most weapons are 1 dimensional by dealing damage through pressing its respective button. An advanced weapon may also have a secondary ability found as a charged attack with an equally exciting execution; holding down and releasing its respective button. Combat is reduced to single button mashing with brief periods of secondary button holding. Simple combat rules are negligible if enemy health is in proportion to damage per blow. Attacking in Cube World however feels meaningless since so little damage is done to your enemy per blow, with most single enemy battles lasting around 20 to 30 seconds. Generally, 3 enemies are able to deplete all life resources, and most enemies spawn in packs of 3. Thus a spiral of death and mindless frustration occurs. Enemy design needs to be approached to allow for a friendly introduction of lower health enemies with a potentially more forgiving AI, transitioning into a more dynamic AI that can provide epic long fights. Fighting needs to allow for abstract player interaction and have its difficulty be rooted from mechanical execution and dynamic battle movements.</p>

<p>Together, the environment of exploration and the combat with enemies contradict each other. On one hand the game presents an enticing free flowing world which is interesting, open, and dynamic. On the other hand game progression is based on experience earned through combat which is a very slow, linear, and provides an uninspiring experience. There is no purpose to exploration since its progression; finding castles, dungeons, and towns, is relied upon being able to explore them, which in turn is congested by fighting enemies. If the act of exploration is slowed down, or combat sped up, these mechanics would compliment each other and provide a more satisfying experience.</p>

<p>But perhaps, as I was told by a viewer in <a href="http://twitch.tv/jeven_">my Twitch live stream</a> of Cube World:</p>
