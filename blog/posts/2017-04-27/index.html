<h2>The Nintendo New 2DS XL</h2>
<h3>Posted by Jeven</h3>
<em>2017 04 27</em>

<p>I have been wanting a 2DS with a specific colour scheme...</p>

<p>with a larger screen...</p>

<p>for over a month actually...</p>

<p>and 2 hours ago Nintendo announced this:</p>

<p>Before noting my distaste for the hardware in this announcement (oh, so much for not making note of it) I would like describe why I wanted a 2DS in the first place.</p>

<p>This device may not be the most attractive brick of plastic released in the decade of 2010 but there is elegance in the simplicity of it. There are no moving parts to break, or special features hidden away within the case. What you see is what you get. The longer body provides more room to rest larger hands on without cramping fingers, and there is a nostalgic retro feel to the design. The launch colour schemes consisted of a basic pair of black with red or blue, with the clean lines and corners of the case tying it all together.</p>

<p>The game library is phenomenal. Not only does it have access to the entire current Nintendo 3DS library, but also the Nintendo DS/DS lite/DSi (previous console generation) library is compatible. There is over a decade of games available dating back to 2004. Oh right... the Nintendo virtual shop with games from the entire Game Boy line and the NES is packed inside. Lost is the 3D image feature from the 3DS, an NFC reader (dropping the ability to scan amiibos that hold DLC like content or work like an external memory card), and the system is downgraded to a single mono speaker (although still packing stereo audio with headphones). If you are in the market for playing some awesome games while ignoring the fireworks, this system works as a great option against the flagship 3DS.</p>

<p>All this for less than half the cost of a New 3DS XL (50% to 30% the cost, depending on the market -- Canada and USA are used for these figures). My only impulse purchase prevention was that the 2DS sports a 3.5 inch screen. What can I say, a 4.5 inch screen in the form of a "2DS XL" would be great!</p>

<p>Enter the New 2DS XL. The perfect system. A 2DS with slightly upgraded hardware for new potential 3DS games, and a glorious 4.5 inch screen. No. Wrong.</p>

<p> es the new system does have upgraded hardware, a 4.8 inch screen as found in the 3DS XL, an NFC reader, 2 stereo speakers, the 3DS clam shell design -- wait how does this differ from a 3DS? The only component lacking from the New 2DS XL is the 3D video. All of the included features, personally good or bad, would be acceptable if the main selling point of the 2DS was still relevant; the low price. Buying a New 2DS XL gets you over 3/4 of the way to a New 3DS XL (85% to 75% the cost of the 3DS XL, again depending on sale location). In other words, you could purchase almost two 2DS systems for the price of one New 2DS XL, and almost three 2DS systems for the price of one New 3DS XL.</p>

<p>The easy affordable access to one of the worlds greatest line ups of games utilizing interesting hybrid touch screen mechanics is gone. A New 2DS XL offers a flagship 3DS at a negligibly lower cost, while dropping the biggest feature of the 3DS (the 3D feature is in the name, come on!).</p>

<p>"Fine. Ignore the New 2DS XL if you do not like it."</p>

<p>Introducing this device can only be inferred as the first step to phase out the original 2DS, which has been on the market for over 3 years. The new system inherits the "New" branding, featured by the only currently purchasable 3DS consoles direct from Nintendo. All other initial 3DS models have been phased out, creating a similar framework for the 2DS line. Also, any newly produced games for the 3DS are no longer guaranteed to run on a 2 or 3DS who are not members of the "New" brand.</p>

<p>I am pointed towards regarding this announcement as a step against a simple accessible economic method of play, which is what I loved dearly about the initial 2DS (after the post launch price drop). I hope the entry level void left by the first 2DS with be filled with a "New 2DS" (not XL) possessing a similar design and price philosophy of the initial system, since sadly the New 2DS XL does not fit the same niche as the original Nintendo 2DS.</p>
