<h2>I like Adventures; An Introduction</h2>
<h3>Posted by Jeven</h3>
<em>2017 03 29</em>

<p><b>I am going on an adventure</b> through the beautiful world of the electronic art form we all love to call "video games", and I am making note of my personal angle and perspective about each experience. I have no outstanding skills or knowledge about what I am going to share, but I am passionate about games, have an internet connection, and a strong opinion. You should expect less formal, more conversation/rant style posts, and disagreeing or agreeing, I would absolutely love if you commented with your opinion as well.</p>

<p>So until next time, this is where I get off.</p>
